# Binary Trees vs Arrays and Linked Lists
# Benefits of Binary Trees over Arrays and Linked Lists:

# Arrays
 are fast when you want to access an element directly, like element number 700 in an array of 1000 elements for example. But inserting and deleting elements require other elements to shift in memory to make place for the new element, or to take the deleted elements place, and that is time consuming.

# Linked Lists
 are fast when inserting or deleting nodes, no memory shifting needed, but to access an element inside the list, the list must be traversed, and that takes time.

# Binary Trees
 such as Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees, are great compared to Arrays and Linked Lists because they are BOTH fast at accessing a node, AND fast when it comes to deleting or inserting a node, with no shifts in memory needed.

# Types of Binary Trees
There are different variants, or types, of Binary Trees worth discussing to get a better understanding of how Binary Trees can be structured.

The different kinds of Binary Trees are also worth mentioning now as these words and concepts will be used later in the tutorial.

Below are short explanations of different types of Binary Tree structures, and below the explanations are drawings of these kinds of structures to make it as easy to understand as possible.

 # A balanced Binary Tree has at most 1 in difference between its left and right subtree heights, for each node in the tree.

# A complete Binary Tree has all levels full of nodes, except the last level, which is can also be full, or filled from left to right. The properties of a complete Binary Tree means it is also balanced.

# A full Binary Tree is a kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes.

# A perfect Binary Tree has all leaf nodes on the same level, which means that all levels are full of nodes, and all internal nodes have two child nodes.The properties of a perfect Binary Tree means it is also full, balanced, and complete.
